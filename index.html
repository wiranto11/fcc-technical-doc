            Advanced CSS is a set of tools and techniques that help you create
            the modern websites that employers and clients are looking for.
            These skills help you make websites more responsive more easily so,
            whatever kind or size of device someone is using to view your site,
            it looks fantastic and works well. No more overlapping images or
            tiny text!
          </p>
          <p>
            Advanced CSS also allows you to structure your web pages more
            efficiently. Yep, that means you can forget floats (!!!) but still
            position and align elements exactly the way you want and have your
            content flexibly change size or location just the way you need it
            to. Or you can use advanced CSS to completely customize a site by
            styling only certain elements or automatically adapting content.
          </p>
          <code></code>
          <p>
            Not only will advanced CSS skills make it possible for you to build
            and style the kinds of sites that are most in demand nowadays, but
            they’ll also let you do it more quickly, easily, and efficiently.
            You’ll be able to get more done with less code, and the code you do
            write will be more understandable and organized, so you’ll be able
            to work better both on your own and on a team.

            CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the
            time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other
            style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same
            time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide
            Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)
            being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was
            influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as
            co-creator of CSS.

            Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the
            beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the
            1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.
            One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets
            to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style
            sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the
            other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style
            sheets by way of "cascading" styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic
            capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution
            gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of
            more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such
            as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb, made consistent site appearance
            difficult, and users had less control over how web content was
            displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style
            sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could
            therefore not be linked to documents on the web. Robert Cailliau,
            also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation
            so that different style sheets could describe different presentation
            for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.
